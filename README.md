#Udacity Neighborhood Map project
This project creates a map object of my surrounding neighborhood with some recommended restaurants using Google Maps API and additional information from FourSquare.  Includes a search box to filter restaurants based on user input.  GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/YouKnowBagu/neighborhood-map)

## Libraries Used
- Knockout.js, a Javascript library to implement the model-view-viewmodel concept.  Updates UI fluidly whenever data model changes.
- jQuery Javacript library, used for AJAX calls and DOM manipulation in this project.

## Quick Start
Clone or download the repository [here](https://github.com/YouKnowBagu/neighborhood-map).  Open index.html in your favorite browser and you're done!
